			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Politics, Media, Popular Culture</strong><br />
In this course, we will examine U.S. politics and popular culture in the period 1941-2015. We will analyze political films ranging from the World War II propaganda series, <em>Why We Fight</em>, to more recent feature films such as <em>Wag the Dog</em> and <em>Good Night and Good Luck</em>.  We will consider television’s impact on civic culture, focusing on entertainment programs (<em>I Led 3 Lives</em>, <em>24</em>, <em>Scandal</em>), the news (<em>See It Now</em>, <em>The O’Reilly Factor</em>), campaign commercials, and political satire (<em>The Daily Show</em>, <em>The Colbert Report</em>). Finally, we will assess how online organizing and the blogosphere impact civic participation. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Black Comic Cultures</strong><br />
In this course we will explore a range of black comic cultures, analyzing their emergence and transformation from the early 20th century to the present. Specifically, we will examine blackface minstrels of the early 20th century such as George Walker and Bert Williams, Bill Cosby’s performances in the 60s, and the ribald humor of LaWanda Page’s 1970s party records, before moving to the urban scene embodied in television shows such as <em>Def Comedy Jam</em>. We will also engage with theoretical materials that help us analyze black comedy as multidimensional, such as John Limon’s <em>Stand-up Comedy in Theory</em>, or, <em>Abjection in America</em>. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

A study of literary and other cultural forms in early America, including gravestones, architecture, furniture and visual art.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>See the U.S.A.: The History of Tourism in American Culture</strong><br />
In this course, we will explore the history and evolution of American tourism, beginning in the 1820s, when middle-class tourists first journeyed up the Hudson River valley, and ending with our contemporary and continuing obsession with iconic destinations such as Graceland, Gettysburg, and the Grand Canyon. We will explore how the growth of national transportation systems, the development of advertising, and the rise of a middle class with money and time to spend on leisure shaped the evolution of tourism.  Along the way, we will study various types of tourism (such as historical, cultural, ethnic, eco-, and 'disaster' tourism) and look at the creative processes by which places are transformed into 'destinations'.  Our texts will come from visual art, travel literature, material culture, and film and television.  We will consider their cultural meaning and reflect on our own motivations and responses as tourists, and by so doing contemplate why tourism was-and still is-such an important part of American life. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sexuality in the United States: Histories and Identities</strong><br />
What does sexuality mean? In the United States the meanings of sexuality are highly contested, historically and in the present. Working from an interdisciplinary perspective, we will look at different historical and theoretical approaches to thinking about issues of sexuality and to writing its histories. Drawing from feminist scholarship, queer theory, and lesbian, gay, and transgender studies, we will discuss sexual identities, representations of sexuality, and sexual cultures, and examine how intersecting categories such as race, class, disability, and gender influence how sexuality is understood. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Black Archives</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the archives of black thinkers such as Ralph Ellison, Robert Lynch, Claude McKay, Toni Morrison, Kara Walker, and Richard Wright. We will read rejected and lost manuscripts, unpublished drafts and notes, photographs, and complete diaries and novels that have never been read by the public but instead relegated to the archive. By recovering these lost texts, we will engage in activism by unsilencing these silenced black texts. To accomplish this task, students will manage a hardcopy archive and curate a digital archive. Topics will include diaspora and representation, personal and collective memory, gender and disability studies, and theories of the archive. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

In this course we will examine the history, meanings, and realities of disability in the United States. We will analyze the social, political, economic, environmental, and material factors that shape the meanings of "disability," examining changes and continuities over time. Students will draw critical attention to the connections between disability, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and age in American and transnational contexts. Diverse sources, including films and television shows, music, advertising, fiction, memoirs, and material objects, encourage inter and multi-disciplinary approaches to disability. Central themes we consider include language, privilege, community, citizenship, education, medicine and technology, and representation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Across the Great Divide:  Science, Humanities, and the American Landscape</strong><br />
The American landscape encompasses a diversity of built and natural environments. In this course, we will survey 200 years of history, using the tools of science and the humanities to understand how people have changed the landscape and how the landscape has shaped its human inhabitants. We will read historical, literary, and scientific works—and employ a variety of archival and aesthetic materials—to explore moments of transformation within four geographic regions: New England, the Midwest, the West, and the South. In so doing, we will arrive at an understanding of the interdependency of cultural and ecological history and the intersections between scientific and humanistic modes of inquiry. Readings will emphasize primary texts, and will include writings by Harriett Beecher Stowe, George Perkins Marsh, and photography by Dorothea Lange and others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Issues in Critical Disability Studies: U.S. and the World</strong><br />
Disability as a category and as lived experience plays an important but often overlooked role in national, transnational, and global contexts. In this course we will explore disability’s changing meanings in the United States and around the World. Comparative and transnational approaches will draw our attention to disability’s many meanings across wide-ranging historical, cultural, and geographical settings. Foundational concepts and principles, including ableism and Universal Design, shape our critical inquiry. Key themes frame the course: access, language, power, violence, normalcy, identity, community, institutions, and rights and justice. We will engage with diverse primary sources, from memoirs and documentary films to advertisements, material objects, and oral histories.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geographic Perspectives on International Development</strong><br />
This class is an exploration of some of the key concepts, theories, ideologies, and practices of international development as they relate to issues of environmental and social change. We will approach these “ways of knowing” about development and the environment through three   topics: (1) “natural” disasters; (2) oil; and (3) waste. For each of these topics we will draw on multiple case studies across the world including Haiti, New Orleans, Pakistan, India, Nigeria, and  South Africa. These case studies will help us to more fully discuss and understand the dynamics of who does development, how, where, why, and with what results. With each of the themes we will examine different practices of international development,  including  post-disaster international aid, the shipping and dumping of waste, and  environmental conflicts in the everyday lives of people in oil-rich areas of the world. This approach will allow us to break down mainstream discourses of development and “sustainability,” critically examine development practice, and imagine alternative approaches to development. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Urban Geography</strong><br />
Urban landscapes are the expression of economic, political, and socio-cultural processes layered on top of each other in particular time-space contexts. In this course, students will theoretically and empirically examine the complex and dynamic urban landscape. Students will gain a theoretical understanding of the location of cities within a larger global economic system of cities, along with the internal organization of economic, cultural, and social functions within cities. We will also examine the processes behind contemporary urban issues such as homelessness, boosterism, urban renewal, gentrification, poverty, and crime. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geopolitics of the Middle East</strong><br />
This course examines the Middle East from a geographical perspective with emphasis on the historical and political underpinnings of the region. The Middle East, the cradle of civilization, has been, due to its geography, one of the major arenas for political and ideological conflicts. It has been subject to an unequal power relationship with the West, which, together with Islam, has affected the level of its political, social, and economic development. This course will provide an analytical introduction to the historical, political, social, and economic geography of the region and will analyze the major transitions this region has undergone. 3 hrs.lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Health & Medical Geography</strong><br />
In this course we will explore three major geographic approaches to studying health, morbidity, health care, and human wellbeing using a variety of approaches: 1) ecological, in which the relationship between human and environment is analyzed; 2) social, including socio-behavioral and political economy approaches; and 3) spatial analytic, which draw on mapping, geospatial, and spatial statistical techniques to identify patterns. We will apply these approaches to case studies from North America, South East Asia, Sub-Saharan Afric,a and elsewhere. We will also consider spatial variation of pandemics and trans-world connections and processes relevant to global health. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geomorphologyic Process</strong><br />
In this course we will investigate processes that shape the Earth's surface, including weathering, mass movements, and the effects of water, wind, and ice. Students will examine how such processes govern the evolution of landforms in differing climatic, tectonic, and lithologic settings. Field and laboratory study will focus on the role of active surficial processes, as well as glaciation and other past events, in development of the landscape of west-central Vermont. We will also discuss implications for human activities and maintenance of natural systems. (GEOL 0112 or GEOL 0161 or GEOL 0170 or by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Practicing Human Geography</strong><br />
Asking and answering geographical questions often invokes a variety of specific spatial-analytical techniques and methodologies. In Practicing Human Geography, students will employ a variety of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in specific research contexts. Through lectures, examples, and readings, students will learn the types of questions each technique is designed to answer, how it works, and how to interpret the results. During weekly discussion sections, students will gain hands on experience with various software packages and employ these techniques to complete a series of research exercises. These research exercises, participation, and a final exam will form the basis for evaluation. (GEOG 0100, and at least one 0200 level course in geography) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Practicing Human Geography</strong><br />
Asking and answering geographical questions often invokes a variety of specific spatial-analytical techniques and methodologies. In Practicing Human Geography, students will employ a variety of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in specific research contexts. Through lectures, examples, and readings, students will learn the types of questions each technique is designed to answer, how it works, and how to interpret the results. During weekly discussion sections, students will gain hands on experience with various software packages and employ these techniques to complete a series of research exercises. These research exercises, participation, and a final exam will form the basis for evaluation. (GEOG 0100, and at least one 0200 level course in geography) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar in Feminist Geography</strong><br />
Feminist geographers have made major contributions to the discipline of Geography over the past several decades. In this course we will focus on how feminist geography might help us to address critical questions about spatiality and power relations. We will read key writings on feminist thought and practice and consider how axes of difference from gender and race, to sexuality and class work to constitute particular spaces and places. Seminar readings will also engage different methodological approaches employed by feminist scholars. We will focus on feminist contributions to understandings of knowledge production, work and social reproduction, development, globalization, and political processes. (Senior majors only; others by waiver) 3 hr. sem.]]></description>

America often has been defined paradoxically as both the "most religious" and "least religious" of nations. This course, a historical survey of American religious life, will trace the unique story of American religion from colonial times to the present. Guiding our exploration will be the ideas of "contact," "conflict," and "combination." Along the way, we will examine the varieties of religious experiences and traditions that have shaped and been shaped by American culture such as, Native American traditions, Puritan life and thought, evangelicalism, immigration, African-American religious experience, women's movements, and the on-going challenges of religious diversity.  Readings include sermons, essays, diaries and fiction, as well as secondary source material.  2 hrs. lect. 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

Readings include sermons, essays, diaries and fiction, as well as secondary source material.  2 hrs. lect. 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Modern Logic</strong><br />
Logic is concerned with good reasoning; as such, it stands at the core of the liberal arts. In this course we will develop our reasoning skills by identifying and analyzing arguments found in philosophical, legal, and other texts, and also by formulating our own arguments. We will use the formal techniques of modern propositional and predicate logic to codify and test various reasoning strategies and specific arguments. No prior knowledge of logic, formal mathematics, or computer science is presupposed in this course, which does not count towards the PHL distribution requirement but instead towards the deductive reasoning requirement. PHIL 0180 is not open to students who have already taken PHIL 0280/LNGT0280. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.]]></description>
