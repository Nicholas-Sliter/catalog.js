Integrating a range of sources and methods, we will examine myths, symbols, values, and social changes that have been used to create and contest ideas of \"Americanness.\" Sources for the course will include movies, fiction, political and religious tracts, advertising, TV shows, video games, music, and journalism. This year, we will focus on American portrayals of crime and violence in a wide range of texts and cultural artifacts that provide us with a larger sense of how these representations function in the formation of categories of gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, ethics and religion, as well as socio-economic class in American society. Texts and films will range from True Crime to Pulp Fiction and from street photography to pictures of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. 3 hrs. lect.","title":"Intro to American Studies: Am.

How do race, class, gender, and issues of labor and leisure inflect the middle-class domestic sphere and relate to social concerns outside the home?

We will survey the permutations of desire -- from the sexual to the sacred, the heteroerotic to the homoerotic—in popular Arab culture. We will consider the intersections of gender, nation, race, ethnicity, ability, and sexuality in cinema, literature, and music.

We will see, learn, and use the principles of drawing found in images of humans in the Lascaux Caves and Mayan Reliefs; to expressionists like Egon Schiele; and cartoons from Walt Disney to South Park. Students will develop their own individual cartoon characters and storyboard an archetypical narrative forming a collaborative class animation screened publicly in Twilight.

Demonstrated visual literacy is essential before entering this course where you will begin developing an individual voice and practice as a young artist.   Designed to help develop a cohesive body of work with a personal point of view, this course provides the basic tools needed to express artistic intentions visually, verbally, and in writing.  Weekly group critiques, class discussions about contemporary art theory/art criticism, and regular one-on-one studio visits with the Studio Art faculty and visiting artists provide a broader context for your artwork. This class culminates with a public exhibition curated and promoted by the class as a whole.  In addition, students are guided in the creation of a professional portfolio, including extensive documentation of the artwork produced and multiple versions of an artist statement, both suitable for submission to artist internships, residencies, or graduate schools. Graduating seniors enrolled in ART 700 will curate, mount and promote a solo thesis exhibition.  They will also create and submit a digital portfolio to be archived by the Program in Studio Art. Interested students should contact the professor a minimum of one (1) week prior to online registration. Provide a transcript of all completed Studio Art courses, images of work created, and a brief, 1-2 page description of the media you intend to use and the subject matter you wish to further investigate. Students are expected to have completed two Studio Art classes in the medium they wish to explore before applying for ART 700.

This course explores this question, examining the preparation and initiation of development (gametogenesis, fertilization, cleavages, and gastrulation), the formation of embryonic structure (morphogenesis), the creation of embryonic pattern (pattern formation), and the control of gene expression during embryogenesis.  In lab, students will design and carry out experiments at the cutting edge of developmental biology, incorporating modern cellular, molecular, and genetic techniques with classical embryological approaches.  Fundamental mysteries of development will be investigated in model organisms that best illustrate each process.

In this course we will focus on understanding the genetic basis of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Fragile-X, autism spectrum disorder, Huntington’s, motor neuron degeneration, Parkinson’s, and muscular dystrophy. From classical genetics to modern genomics, we will explore the discovery of the genes involved in brain disorders as well the development of animal models to reveal underlying molecular mechanisms. We will cover these topics through a combination of lectures and detailed analyses and discussions of primary research articles.

The language situation in China is unique both in the modern world and in human history. We will gain a good understanding of sociolinguistics as a scientific field of inquiry through exploring the Chinese situation in this course. Some of the questions we will ask are: What is Mandarin (Modern Standard) Chinese? Who are \"native speakers\" of Mandarin? Are most Chinese people monolingual (speaking only one language) or bilingual (speaking two languages) or even multilingual? How many \"dialects\" are there in China? What is the difference between a \"language\" and a \"dialect\"? Are Chinese characters \"ideographs\", i.e., \"pictures\" that directly represent meaning and have nothing to do with sound? Why has the pinyin romanization system officially adopted in the 1950s never supplanted the Chinese characters? Why are there traditional and simplified characters? We will also explore topics such as power, register, verbal courtesy, gender and language use. Students are encouraged to compare the Chinese situation with societies that they are familiar with.

Landscape, travel, romantic and metaphysical poems by masters such as Qu Yuan, Tao Yuanming, Wang Wei, Li Bai, Du Fu, Su Dongpo and Li Qingzhao will be studied.

To attain a more dispassionate critical perspective we will explore theoretical approaches to the fairy tales through authors such as Zipes, Bottigheimer, Tatar, and Rölleke, and conclude by examining modern variants in prose, poetry, and film.

The major focus is on quantifying relationships between economic variables. Multiple regression identifies the effect of several exogenous variables on an endogenous variable. After exploring the classical regression model, fundamental assumptions underlying this model will be relaxed, and further new techniques will be introduced.

At the heart of this exploration will be a question posed by physicist Arthur Zajonc: “How do we find our own authentic way to an undivided life where meaning and purpose are tightly interwoven with intellect and action, where compassion and care are infused with insight and knowledge?” We will examine how, at this pivotal moment of decision making, you can understand your college career as an act of “cultivating humanity” and how you can meaningfully challenge yourself to take ownership of your intellectual and personal development. Through interdisciplinary and multicultural exploration, drawing from education studies and philosophical, religious, and literary texts, we will engage our course questions by way of student-led discussion, written reflection, and personal, experiential learning practices.

At the heart of this exploration will be a question posed by physicist Arthur Zajonc: “How do we find our own authentic way to an undivided life where meaning and purpose are tightly interwoven with intellect and action, where compassion and care are infused with insight and knowledge?” We will examine how, at this pivotal moment of decision making, you can understand your college career as an act of “cultivating humanity” and how you can meaningfully challenge yourself to take ownership of your intellectual and personal development. Through interdisciplinary and multicultural exploration, drawing from education studies and philosophical, religious, and literary texts, we will engage our course questions by way of student-led discussion, written reflection, and personal, experiential learning practices. In this way we will examine how a liberal arts education might foster the cultivation of an ‘undivided’ life, “the good life”, a life well-lived.

One answer: such reading is not individual but communal. It links readers to each other in aesthetic experience, in ethical and hermeneutic debate, and in appreciation for writers and fellow readers. As we read literary texts from different times, cultures, and genres, we will examine how they anticipate, create, or recreate readerly communities, and how these communities in turn help shape the texts as they are experienced. We will also strive to form our own readerly community—one that is as inclusive and as intellectually generous as possible. We will begin with close analysis of poetry in various forms from various historical periods. We will then read dramas by such playwrights as William Shakespeare, Margaret Edson, and/or Lolita Chakrabarti, as well as two works from among such prose writers as Charles Dickens, Emily Brontë, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, Marilynne Robinson, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, Ian McEwan, Walter Moseley, and Jean Rhys. 3 hrs. lect./disc","title":"Reading Literature","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/SEM","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F20557","text":"Seminar","id":"SEM"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/ENAM","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FENAM","text":"English & American Literatures","id":"ENAM"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/CW","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FCW","text":"CW","id":"CW"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/LIT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FLIT","text":"Literature","id":"LIT"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/F8D24630B317241DC15E1AF9E407B499","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2FF8D24630B317241DC15E1AF9E407B499","text":"James Berg","id":"F8D24630B317241DC15E1AF9E407B499","name":"James Berg","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/RAJ/CON","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FRAJ%2FCON","text":"Robert A.

From boba to K-pop, Asian diasporic culture is undeniably the shared lexicon of a global mainstream. In this course, we will engage with recent literary, televisual, and cinematic works to discern what they express about Asian American history, identity, and cultural politics. What is the difference between appropriation and authenticity? What can “popular” representations tell us about “serious” topics such as capitalism, citizenship, and empire? How does Asian American popular culture enact collective desires for belonging and memory? In particular, we will attend to the gendered and sexual circuits of cultural formation, with units on Asian American girlhood and queer diasporas.

Spurred variously by force, necessity and desire, migrants leave their homes and homelands with regret and with hope.  Writers address the historical forces that propel these migrations: decolonization and neo-colonialism, globalization, warfare, dispossession, political violence, religious conflict, and environmental catastrophe.  They experiment with narrative form and poetic language to explore the experiences of undocumented immigrant workers, exiles, refugees and well-to-do migrants.  We will examine how displacement shapes constructions of identity, history, community and place in texts by writers such as Anzaldua, Ali, Darwish, Diome, Patel, Gomez Pena, Said, Rushdie, and others.

Drawing on contemporary fiction, poetry, and theory, we will consider the intersections of race and capitalism in shaping contemporary epistemologies, institutional practices, and lived experiences in local and global contexts. We will explore how present-day formations of race and capitalism are related to histories of imperialism and the global extraction of labor and resources.  Decolonization implies a deep, complex, and multi-faceted process by which the discourses, knowledges, and practices at the core of capitalism and imperialism(s) and their mechanisms of oppression are challenged and dismantled.

We will discuss these myths with an emphasis on gender politics and oral storytelling, and sometimes discuss how they reemerge in English literature. We will also examine a rare first edition of the Sandys edition (1623) which is owned by Middlebury College’s Special Collections, in addition to a modern annotated edition.

What shifts have taken place in the multi-ethnic literary canon and tradition between the past to current centuries? How has the 21st century yielded new or alternate ways of telling familiar stories? What are the different forms and genres that BIPOC authors turn to in order to articulate social concerns?

with Environmental Icons &amp; Others What do voices from American History, both past and present, reveal about the way race, and privilege shape how we understand conservation, climate change and environmental justice today? How does your voice matter in this current moment? We will consider the foundations of environmental ideas and attitudes. In particular, in this current climate where Black Lives Matter and systemic racism are central in our conversations about place and space, we will explore the construction of environmental narratives and how race impacts environmental participation. In addition, we will explore how representations of the natural environment are structurally and culturally racialized within environmental institutions and the media by engaging in “conversations” with environmental icons such as John Muir and other historical and contemporary figures such as Zora Neale Hurston and  James Baldwin. 3 hrs. sem.","title":"Conversations with Env.

In this seminar we will analyze how “social” questions of power, political economy, and social struggle, pervade the “natural” (and vice versa). Such questions are invariably messy and full of surprises, confounding reduction to universal theories extended from afar. Often, they require a close in-the-weeds look. That is what this class will invite you to do. The field of political ecology offers a rich repertoire of approaches for developing empirically grounded, historically contextualized, and theoretically nuanced forms of analysis that grapple with the situated complexities of resource and environmental issues.

In this course, we will examine East Asian religions through the lens of eating practices.

learn about agroecology as a set of practices, a philosophy, and a social movement.

Course materials and assignments offer different disciplinary approaches and writing styles, fostering both individual and collective work. Films, on-line exhibits, music, advertising, popular media, and the material world reflect the wide range of sources on which this course draws. Dominant issues, including representation, education, employment, bioethics, institutions, community, policies, access, and justice serve as touchstones for research, analysis, and learning. Sustained attention to interlocking identities, including disability, race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, socioeconomic class, gender, sexual orientation and identification, and age define the field of disability studies and this course.

We will consider how writers portray cultural, national, temporal, and linguistic frontiers; how literature embodies the experience of crossing or dwelling within borderlands; how texts reinforce or transgress the boundaries at which we are positioned as readers; and how writing itself can construct and bridge differences. Reading poems and stories of liminal figures—em/immigrants, expatriates, exiles, animals, misfits, racial others, queers, and adventurers—we will analyze how borders challenge our ideas about place, body, identity, language, and text. In encounters with hybrid genres and multimedia texts that disrupt the way we read, we will explore the edges of language. For a broader picture of the border in the human imagination, we will also turn to films and other arts. Texts may include Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home, Justin Torres’ We the Animals, James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room, and Claudia Rankine’s Citizen, among others. 3 hrs. sem.","title":"Literary Borders","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/SEM","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22989","text":"Seminar","id":"SEM"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/FYSE","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FFYSE","text":"First-Year Seminar Program","id":"FYSE"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/AMR","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FAMR","text":"America Civilization Requirement","id":"AMR"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/CW","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FCW","text":"CW","id":"CW"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/LIT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FLIT","text":"Literature","id":"LIT"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/F6F8B9D240215C1641D2971E1E959241","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2FF6F8B9D240215C1641D2971E1E959241","text":"Stacie Cassarino","id":"F6F8B9D240215C1641D2971E1E959241","name":"Stacie Cassarino","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MCC/CREST","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMCC%2FCREST","text":"McCullough CREST","id":"MCC/CREST","room":"CREST","building":"MCC"},"schedule":{"text":"11:00am-12:15pm on Tuesday, Thursday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"11:00am-12:15pm on Tuesday, Thursday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"11:00 AM","endTime":"12:15 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22989","href":null,"text":"22989","id":"22989"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/FYSE","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FFYSE","text":"First Year Seminar","id":"FYSE"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22936","code":"FYSE1585A-S22","description":"How Money Makes the World Go Round Our society is structured around money – how to get it, how to spend it, how to amass it.

These processes tend to homogenize cultures and tastes and are therefore a source of conflict over heritage, memory, and power. These clashes over the “nature” of society embody the global-local divide. In this course we will interrogate not only when and how the flow of goods and ideas occur but the where, as well. We will examine the geographical impact of these flows, and question why some people/places are more affected by globalization than others. 3 hr lecture.","title":"Geographies of Globalization","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/LCT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22847","text":"Lecture","id":"LCT"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/GEOG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FGEOG","text":"Geography","id":"GEOG"},"requirements":[],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/798336D763BAF962081BCC85267BD218","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2F798336D763BAF962081BCC85267BD218","text":"Tamar Mayer","id":"798336D763BAF962081BCC85267BD218","name":"Tamar Mayer","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/RAJ/CON","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FRAJ%2FCON","text":"Robert A.

In this course, students will explore quantitative and qualitative methodologies and the ways they can be used in human geography research. Through examples, exercises, and readings, students will learn the types of questions different techniques are designed to answer, how they work, and how to interpret the results. Students will gain hands on experience conducting surveys, generating and interpreting qualitative data, selecting and implementing statistical analyses, and writing research reports, to build competence and critical awareness in the practice and communication of research.

Spurred variously by force, necessity and desire, migrants leave their homes and homelands with regret and with hope.  Writers address the historical forces that propel these migrations: decolonization and neo-colonialism, globalization, warfare, dispossession, political violence, religious conflict, and environmental catastrophe.  They experiment with narrative form and poetic language to explore the experiences of undocumented immigrant workers, exiles, refugees and well-to-do migrants.  We will examine how displacement shapes constructions of identity, history, community and place in texts by writers such as Anzaldua, Ali, Darwish, Diome, Patel, Gomez Pena, Said, Rushdie, and others.

Building our environment begins with regulation and economics, but includes stakeholders with varying influence.

In this course we will consider the different roles interpretation and imagination—fact, fiction, and the porous space between—play in our engagement with works of art.  We will read recent fiction, history, poetry and criticism as well as writing that purposefully sidesteps these categories not only to engage the limits of the archive and its objects but also to explore the critical and aesthetic possibilities of writing beyond the binary of fiction and nonfiction.

In our fractious and turbo-charged world, what are the objects and experiences that still have the power to bring us up short, leaving us slack-jawed and spellbound? This seminar will engage these questions in preparation for a cross-disciplinary exhibit at the Middlebury College Museum of Art in 2024. Grounding our conversation in early literary and artistic explorations of the sublime, we will also consider awe through the lenses of religion, scientific discovery, creativity, and the natural world. Definitions of awe almost invariably include references to fear, dread, even terror, so readings and class discussions will move well beyond the celebratory and reverential. There are no prerequisites for this course, and students from a wide range of majors and fields of interest are encouraged to enroll. Projects and written assignments will allow students to make direct contributions to the exhibition. 3 hrs. sem.

Together, these achievements represent a fundamental shift in Western Europe from an impoverished, besieged society to a dynamic civilization that established the institutions and assumptions on which the modern West is based.

Much of our focus will be on the Company’s presence in India, and we will pay particular attention to its transformation from a maritime trading company into a territorial colonial state. We will read a number of controversial texts from the period, immerse ourselves in the worlds of Company and Indian politics, and do guided research using holdings in Middlebury’s Special Collections. Topics will include the rise of the Company as a trading concern, its aggressive competition with other European trading monopolies and South Asian kingdoms, and the importance of opium in its dealings with China. We will end with a discussion of the Indian rebellion of 1857.

We will examine this attempt to create a just society and the corresponding violence against internal and external enemies.

How is it that nuclear war never broke out by the time the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991? This course traces the complex relationship between nuclear security, international relations, and domestic politics through the initial development of nuclear weapons, Cold War arms race, emergence of independent Russia, and contemporary tensions. How did shifting social and political environments shape nuclear security concerns? Why, despite the end of the ideological Cold War, did the early 21st century witness the collapse of bilateral arms control and nonproliferation cooperation between Russia and the USA?

Developing countries have to accelerate their growth rates, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, create productive employment, and address pressing environmental concerns.

We will pursue this against the backdrop of Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen’s path breaking work, “Development as Freedom” and bring in case studies from Asia, Latin America and Africa.  We will focus on different development strategies adopted, choice of policy instruments, methods of implementation, all the while asking if development is indeed an integrated process of expansion of substantive human freedoms that connect with one another for a higher purpose.

Project themes vary by term, but all projects focus on local and regional issues in science that have broader applications.

Our examination of these frameworks will necessarily involve critical comparisons among the countries in which they have been employed. We will identify goals, strategies, and assumptions within each framework, as well as our role in social transformation in conjunction with other actors.

We will also consider how contemporary Western essays and media (some in translation) re-engage the Decameron.

This course will be taught in English; no Japanese language or linguistics knowledge required. 3 hrs. lect./disc.","title":"Intro Japanese Linguistics","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/LCT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22250","text":"Lecture","id":"LCT"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/JAPN","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FJAPN","text":"Japanese Studies","id":"JAPN"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/AAL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FAAL","text":"AAL","id":"AAL"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/NOA","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FNOA","text":"North Asia Civilization Requirement","id":"NOA"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/AF447BBF7AAA4D008D807A660462F04B","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2FAF447BBF7AAA4D008D807A660462F04B","text":"Sayaka Abe","id":"AF447BBF7AAA4D008D807A660462F04B","name":"Sayaka Abe","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MBH/338","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMBH%2F338","text":"McCardell Bicentennial Hall 338","id":"MBH/338","room":"338","building":"MBH"},"schedule":{"text":"8:40am-9:55am on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"8:40am-9:55am on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"8:40 AM","endTime":"9:55 AM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22119","href":null,"text":"22119","id":"22119"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/JAPN","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FJAPN","text":"Japanese","id":"JAPN"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22602","code":"JAPN0214A-S22","description":"Modern and Contemporary Japanese Women Writers A thousand years ago, women writers dominated the Japanese literary world. Then, for centuries, their skill was discounted, their works overlooked, and their voices silenced. Starting with the nineteenth century, however, Japanese women writers started to reclaim their grandmothers’ heritage. They took the male-dominated literary world by assault, pushing boundaries, drawing on their literary legacy and reinventing it, resisting the label of “women’s literature” so often pejoratively attached to their works.  In this course we will explore these figures of resistance and their multilayered works in the context of the changing socio-political conditions that shaped women’s positions in Japanese society. 3 hrs. lect.","title":"Modern Japanese Women Writers","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/LCT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22602","text":"Lecture","id":"LCT"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/JAPN","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FJAPN","text":"Japanese Studies","id":"JAPN"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/AAL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FAAL","text":"AAL","id":"AAL"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/LIT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FLIT","text":"Literature","id":"LIT"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/NOA","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FNOA","text":"North Asia Civilization Requirement","id":"NOA"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/A652069B034A757D4A0E017533F48992","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2FA652069B034A757D4A0E017533F48992","text":"Otilia Milutin","id":"A652069B034A757D4A0E017533F48992","name":"Otilia Milutin","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MBH/219","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMBH%2F219","text":"McCardell Bicentennial Hall 219","id":"MBH/219","room":"219","building":"MBH"},"schedule":{"text":"2:50pm-4:05pm on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"2:50pm-4:05pm on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"2:50 PM","endTime":"4:05 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22602","href":null,"text":"22602","id":"22602"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/JAPN","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FJAPN","text":"Japanese","id":"JAPN"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F21943","code":"JAPN0228A-S22","description":"Japanese Religions We will begin our study of Japanese religions with the ancient mythology that forms the basis of Shinto (the way of the kami, or gods).

The rapid rise of the Islamic State has taken counterterrorism policymakers and foreign policy practitioners by surprise. In an effort for students to come to a common understanding of key terms that will be discussed throughout the course, a session will be devoted to understanding key concepts and terms related to Islamic history. In this regard, students should take away from the course a baseline understanding of Islamic jurisprudence, meaning of the caliphate, the five pillars of Islam, and Shar’ia law. The course will trace the history of the Islamic State’s rise and will examine the leadership figures/personalities behind the group. The course will also examine the Islamic State’s connection and ultimate divorce from al-Qa’ida. The course will all examine how the group finances its operations as well as the rise of its affiliates. Finally, the course will also explore the group’s use of foreign fighters and social media to further its agenda. Global responses in an effort to counter the Islamic State will also be discussed.

In this course students will learn about the history of Brazilian soccer and how it became a “religion”. This history begins in 1895 when Charles Miller, coming from England, organized in São Paulo the first soccer game ever played in Brazil. Since then, the sport has deeply permeated Brazilian culture and arts (literature, music, cinema). Topics to be examined in this historical context are race, social class, gender, politics, and national identity. Materials to be discussed include fictional and non-fictional texts, songs, videos, and movies. Depending on the number of students enrolled, the course will be scheduled to have one soccer practice and one game (against another team) during the semester.

No prior knowledge of logic, formal mathematics, or computer science is presupposed in this course, which does not count towards the PHL distribution requirement but instead towards the deductive reasoning requirement. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.","title":"Introduction to Modern Logic","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/LCT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F21497","text":"Lecture","id":"LCT"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/PHIL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FPHIL","text":"Philosophy","id":"PHIL"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/DED","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FDED","text":"Deductive Reasoning and Analytical Processes","id":"DED"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/ED16FFB18CB76EA016EC85B22F9DAF28","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2FED16FFB18CB76EA016EC85B22F9DAF28","text":"Kareem Khalifa","id":"ED16FFB18CB76EA016EC85B22F9DAF28","name":"Kareem Khalifa","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/AXT/201","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FAXT%2F201","text":"Twilight Hall 201","id":"AXT/201","room":"201","building":"AXT"},"schedule":{"text":"1:45pm-2:35pm on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"1:45pm-2:35pm on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"1:45 PM","endTime":"2:35 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"21497","href":null,"text":"21497","id":"21497"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/PHIL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FPHIL","text":"Philosophy","id":"PHIL"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F21896","code":"PHIL0250A-S22","description":"Early Modern Philosophy This course offers an introduction to some of the most influential European philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries: Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.

Are those changes all for the good? In this course we will explore the political, legal, and normative implications of the Internet for liberal democracy. We start with the US Constitution and explore arguments that it cannot by itself prevent the Internet from becoming a domain of manipulation rather than of freedom.

We will also explore how appreciating the complexities of emotions might improve emotion regulation and interpersonal dynamics.

Drawing on new research insights from around the globe, we will explore cross-cultural variations in psychological functioning from emotions, cognitions, and perceptions, to development, personality, and mental health.

We will address major themes in developmental psychology, such as the interrelatedness of development across domains, the contributions of nature and nurture, and the relative continuity versus discontinuity of developmental change.

We will examine how these led to the assumptions underlying ‘Buddhist Modernism’ both in Asia and the West. Materials will include texts and films on traditional Buddhism, historical, social, and intellectual analyses of its transformations, as well as narratives of individuals’ lives. 3 hrs. lect.","title":"Buddhism in the Modern World","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/LCT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22757","text":"Lecture","id":"LCT"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/CMP","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FCMP","text":"Comparative Requirement","id":"CMP"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/PHL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FPHL","text":"Philosophical and Religious Studies","id":"PHL"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/EAB584A8331F02DFDA15E844A9F20D72","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2FEAB584A8331F02DFDA15E844A9F20D72","text":"William Waldron","id":"EAB584A8331F02DFDA15E844A9F20D72","name":"William Waldron","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MNR/406","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMNR%2F406","text":"Munroe Hall 406","id":"MNR/406","room":"406","building":"MNR"},"schedule":{"text":"11:00am-12:15pm on Tuesday, Thursday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"11:00am-12:15pm on Tuesday, Thursday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"11:00 AM","endTime":"12:15 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22757","href":null,"text":"22757","id":"22757"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22915","code":"RELI0226A-S22","description":"Food in East Asian Religions One might think that food and eating have nothing to do with the lofty concerns of religious traditions.

In this course, we will examine East Asian religions through the lens of eating practices.

Paintings, cinematography, and literary narratives from The Protevangelium of James and Maximus the Confessor, to Dostoevsky, Kazantzakis, Sholem Asch, Saramago, Flannery O'Connor, and Marilynne Robinson, will invite the question: how have word and image shaped the understanding of the sacred stories and Christian imagination? Through close readings of the New Testament and exegetical discussion combining systematic with narrative theology, we will analyze style and composition, situate the texts in their historical context, and explore various readers’ perspectives, ancient and modern. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.","title":"New Testament Narrative Art","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/LCT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22713","text":"Lecture","id":"LCT"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/CMP","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FCMP","text":"Comparative Requirement","id":"CMP"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/LIT","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FLIT","text":"Literature","id":"LIT"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/PHL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FPHL","text":"Philosophical and Religious Studies","id":"PHL"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/4126E0ADF7A8944EFD02D220C6C70D49","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2F4126E0ADF7A8944EFD02D220C6C70D49","text":"Maria Hatjigeorgiou","id":"4126E0ADF7A8944EFD02D220C6C70D49","name":"Maria Hatjigeorgiou","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MNR/409","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMNR%2F409","text":"Munroe Hall 409","id":"MNR/409","room":"409","building":"MNR"},"schedule":{"text":"3:00pm-4:15pm on Tuesday, Thursday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"3:00pm-4:15pm on Tuesday, Thursday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"3:00 PM","endTime":"4:15 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22657","href":null,"text":"22657","id":"22657"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F21945","code":"RELI0293A-S22","description":"Ethics in Health Care This course is an introduction to the principles, virtues, and other moral norms that guide decision-making in health care.

The Book of Job asked this question millennia ago, giving not an explicit answer, but at least a response. Framed by a prose tale on the patient Job, the book is mainly a debate in poetry between an impatient Job and his “friends” that has continued to our day, in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought, and in philosophy.  We will study the debate on the meaning of Job in philosophy and religion through the works of Maimonides, Kant, Hume, Voltaire, William Blake, Jung, and others. Familiarity with Biblical studies or philosophy of religion is helpful, but not required. 3 hrs. sem. ","title":"Job and the Problem of Evil","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/SEM","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22712","text":"Seminar","id":"SEM"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/PHL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FPHL","text":"Philosophical and Religious Studies","id":"PHL"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/0AD8E115DEDC0EDC35BBD58E4BD21010","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2F0AD8E115DEDC0EDC35BBD58E4BD21010","text":"Robert Schine","id":"0AD8E115DEDC0EDC35BBD58E4BD21010","name":"Robert Schine","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MNR/416","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMNR%2F416","text":"Munroe Hall 416","id":"MNR/416","room":"416","building":"MNR"},"schedule":{"text":"2:50pm-4:05pm on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"2:50pm-4:05pm on Monday, Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"2:50 PM","endTime":"4:05 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22660","href":null,"text":"22660","id":"22660"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22740","code":"RELI0393A-S22","description":"Crossroads: Religion and Race in the Americas White rock musicians have traced the origins of their musical style to the Delta blues, fixating on a myth that a young, Black musician sold his soul at a southern crossroads to learn to play the guitar. This myth portrays the success of rock as having supernatural origins, while obscuring how the recording industry appropriated and commodified the art of Black Americans. In this seminar we explore the polysemous image of the “crossroads” as an entrée into the intersecting fields of  comparative religion, humanistic economics, and critical race. We will rely on works by authors such as Gloria Anzaldúa and Toni Morrison to interrogate these fields while comparing the histories of the U.S. and Brazil. 3 hrs. sem","title":"Crossroads","alternate":null,"type":{"rawID":"genera:offering/SEM","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F22740","text":"Seminar","id":"SEM"},"department":{"rawID":"topic/department/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fdepartment%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"requirements":[{"rawID":"topic/requirement/AAL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FAAL","text":"AAL","id":"AAL"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/AMR","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FAMR","text":"America Civilization Requirement","id":"AMR"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/CMP","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FCMP","text":"Comparative Requirement","id":"CMP"},{"rawID":"topic/requirement/PHL","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Frequirement%2FPHL","text":"Philosophical and Religious Studies","id":"PHL"}],"instructors":[{"rawID":"resource/person/7C1142898FAE872E26C99907CA3B8872","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fperson%2F7C1142898FAE872E26C99907CA3B8872","text":"Justin Doran","id":"7C1142898FAE872E26C99907CA3B8872","name":"Justin Doran","middleburyID":null}],"location":{"rawID":"resource/place/room/MNR/217","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/resources/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/resource/resource%2Fplace%2Froom%2FMNR%2F217","text":"Munroe Hall 217","id":"MNR/217","room":"217","building":"MNR"},"schedule":{"text":"1:30pm-4:15pm on Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)","meetings":[{"raw":"{\"text\":\"1:30pm-4:15pm on Wednesday (Feb 14, 2022 to May 16, 2022)\"}","startTime":"1:30 PM","endTime":"4:15 PM","startDate":"2022-02-14","endDate":"2022-05-16","days":["Wednesday"],"location":null}]},"crn":{"rawID":"22740","href":null,"text":"22740","id":"22740"},"term":{"rawID":"term/202220","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/terms/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220","text":"Spring 2022","id":"202220","season":"S","year":"2022"},"subject":{"rawID":"topic/subject/RELI","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Fsubject%2FRELI","text":"Religion","id":"RELI"},"level":{"rawID":"topic/level/UG","href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/topics/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/term/term%2F202220/topic/topic%2Flevel%2FUG","text":"Undergraduate","id":"UG"},"alias":null},{"href":"https://catalog.middlebury.edu/offerings/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/offering/section%2F202220%2F20302","code":"RUSS0103A-S22","description":"Beginning Russian This course is a continuation of the approach used in RUSS 0102, but with increased emphasis on reading.

We will study the historical, cultural, and political conditions that have shaped contemporary U.S. cities, such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

Students will read a variety of ethnographic and sociological materials, in order to gain an understanding of the complexities of both urban life and processes of representation.

Using images as our starting point, we will analyze the messages and imagery in visual texts to extract their social meanings.

We will ask the question “What is performance?” and develop the tools to describe, analyze, and interpret a broad range of performances such as plays, political speeches, bullfights, protests, recordings, celebrations, and everyday encounters.  We will focus on performance as a process–oriented, participatory, and experiential way of engaging the world. We will concentrate on the overlapping aspects of performance as/of literature (poetry and drama), as/of everyday life (ritual, identity, and culture), and as/of politics (power, activism, and social change).  We will pay particular attention to the relationship of performance to social culture, investigating the link between performance and race, gender, and sexuality.   Because the goal of the course is to produce critical thinkers who are capable of using performance as an analytical tool and as part of a creative process, students will be required to perform.

We will put special emphasis on a full range of controversial collective narratives and memories that have shaped the Spanish and Portuguese discourses on national identity. We will look for power and social relations that are highlighted by the different and complementary discursive strategies of the dominant and subordinate discourses in both countries.

In this seminar we will explore the role of objects and material culture in shaping colonial discourse during the long history of colonialism in Latin America and the Hispanic Caribbean. Our primary readings assemble an operational canon: from “discovery” and early-contact narratives by Cristóbal Colón and Fray Ramón Pané to the proliferation of ambivalent discourses about colonial subjects, objects, and others that pose a threat to colonial order, including works by Bernardo de Balbuena, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.

From a historical point of view, we will explore literary concepts such as bucolismo and naturalismo, the paleto cinema of the Francoism era and its contestation in Los santos inocentes. From there we will move to contemporary issues such as the vindication of the España vaciada, and new critical approaches such as the glocal, the rurban, and ecofeminism.
